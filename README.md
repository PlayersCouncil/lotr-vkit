Welcome to VKIT for Star Wars CCG! This tool lets you print out all of the "Virtual Cards" for the game.

## Where Can I Ask Questions?
The best place to ask questions about this project is on the Star Wars CCG Players Committee Forums. Specifically, the "Resources" Sub-Form: https://forum.starwarsccg.org/viewforum.php?f=188


## Where are the Images?
* The source of truth for all images is in the [swccg-vkit-images](https://github.com/swccgpc/swccg-vkit-images) git repo.
* Images are uploaded by a GitHub action to the `res.starwarsccg.org` S3 Bucket.
* `allCards.json` is generated from a listing of the images stored in the `res.starwarsccg.org` S3 Bucket.


## Generating the json file

* `create_json.js` lists all the images located at `https://res.starwarsccg.org/vkit/cards/standard/` and creates a json file from it.
* `create_json.js` requires that environment variables, `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, or `AWS_PROFILE` be set.
* Run the script using **NodeJS** and the **AWS-SDK** for Javascript.

```bash
export AWS_PROFILE="swccg-production"
node create_json.js

```

## Deploying

* **vkit** is hosted in the S3 bucket: `vkit.starwarsccg.org`.
* Deploying to the S3 bucket is handled by a **GitHub Action** when merging in to the **Master Branch**.
* For _**YOU**_ to deploy, you must:
  1. Create a `pull request` against this repo
  2. Have the pull request merged to `master`.
* Once @DevoKun or @thomasmarlin approve and merge the pull request the GitHub action will automatically deploy the latest code version.
